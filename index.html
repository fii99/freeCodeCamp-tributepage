          <li>
            <strong>1990</strong> - Wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in
            1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike
            Sendall, who called his proposals "vague, but exciting"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1991</strong> - First posted, on Usenet, a public invitation
            for collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1994</strong> - Founded the W3C at the Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies that were
            willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the
            quality of the Web.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> - Became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage
            Trust, having previously lived in Colehill in Wimborne, East Dorset
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004</strong> - He accepted a chair in computer science at
            the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of
            Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2009</strong> - In a Times article in October 2009,
            Berners-Lee admitted that the initial pair of slashes ("//") in a
            web address were "unnecessary"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2010</strong> - Commenting on the opening up of Ordnance
            Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said: "The changes signal a
            wider cultural change in government based on an assumption that
            information should be in the public domain unless there is a good
            reason not to—not the other way around
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2019</strong> - at the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin
            Berners-Lee and the WWWF launched Contract for the Web, a campaign
            initiative to persuade governments, companies and citizens to commit
            to nine principles to stop "misuse", with the warning that "if we
            don't act now - and act together - to prevent the web being misused
            by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk
            of squandering [its potential for good]"
          </li>
